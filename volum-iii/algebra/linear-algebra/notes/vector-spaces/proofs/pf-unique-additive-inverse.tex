\begin{proof}
Let $v \in V$ and suppose $w, w' \in V$ both satisfy
\[
v + w = \mathbf{0}
\qquad \text{and} \qquad
v + w' = \mathbf{0}.
\]
Then
\[
w
= w + \mathbf{0}
= w + (v + w')
= (w + v) + w'
= \mathbf{0} + w'
= w',
\]
where we used the additive identity, the assumption on $w'$,
associativity, the assumption on $w$, and the additive identity again.
Hence $w = w'$.
\end{proof}
