\begin{proof}
Suppose $\mathbf{0}$ and $\mathbf{0}'$ are both additive identities in $V$. Then
\[
\mathbf{0} = \mathbf{0} + \mathbf{0}' = \mathbf{0}',
\]
where the first equality holds because $\mathbf{0}'$ is an additive identity,
and the second because $\mathbf{0}$ is an additive identity.
Hence $\mathbf{0} = \mathbf{0}'$.
\end{proof}
