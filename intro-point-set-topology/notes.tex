\subsubsection*{Structural Roadmap}

The development of topology follows the same
definition--theorem--structure architecture used throughout
this project, but now abstracts the notion of
\emph{neighborhood structure} independently of distance.

Each major topic is organized as:
\begin{center}
\textbf{Definitions $\longrightarrow$ Main Theorems $\longrightarrow$ Consequences and Logical Structure}
\end{center}

The global progression is:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Definition of a topological space
  \item Open and closed sets
  \item Interior, closure, and boundary
  \item Accumulation (limit) points
  \item Subspace topology
  \item Compactness via open covers
  \item Sequential vs. open-cover compactness
\end{enumerate}

\vspace{1em}

\begin{remark}
Topology isolates the concept of
\emph{open sets} and neighborhood structure
without reference to algebra, order, or distance.
\end{remark}

\begin{remark}
Many notions previously defined using sequences
(convergence, compactness, limit points)
are reinterpreted here in terms of open sets.
\end{remark}

\begin{remark}[Structural Position]
Topology is introduced after metric spaces
to separate the idea of neighborhood structure
from the notion of distance.

This abstraction allows compactness,
continuity, and convergence to be studied
in their most general setting.
\end{remark}
