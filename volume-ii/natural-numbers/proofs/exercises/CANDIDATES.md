# Exercise Candidates — Natural Numbers

Propositions and corollaries whose proofs follow routinely from the surrounding
results. These are future exercise material; they do not appear in `proofs/notes/`.

| Result | Location in notes | What the proof requires |
|--------|-------------------|------------------------|
| P2.2.5 — Associativity of addition | `arithmetic/addition/notes-add-toolkit.tex` | Induction on $a$; uses A1 and A2 directly; straightforward once commutativity pattern is understood |
| P2.2.8 — Sum of positive is positive | `arithmetic/addition/notes-add-toolkit.tex` | Induction on $b$; uses Peano Axiom P3 (successor is nonzero) |
| C2.2.9 — Sum zero implies both zero | `arithmetic/addition/notes-add-toolkit.tex` | Contradiction using P2.2.8; one-step application |
| L2.2.10 — Predecessor lemma | `arithmetic/addition/notes-add-toolkit.tex` | Existence by induction; uniqueness by Axiom P4 (one citation closes it) |
| Cor (Succ is add one) | `arithmetic/addition/notes-add-toolkit.tex` | Direct: $n + 1 = n + (0\pp) = (n+0)\pp = n\pp$ using L2.2.3 then L2.2.2 |
