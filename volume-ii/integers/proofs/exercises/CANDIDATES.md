# Exercise Candidates — Integers

Propositions and corollaries whose proofs follow routinely from surrounding results.

| Result | Location in notes | What the proof requires |
|--------|-------------------|------------------------|
| P4.1.8 — No zero divisors in $\mathbb{Z}$ | `notes-int-tao-construction.tex` | Case analysis using trichotomy (L4.1.5); one case at a time |
| C4.1.9 — Cancellation in $\mathbb{Z}$ | `notes-int-tao-construction.tex` | Immediate from P4.1.8 by contrapositive |
| L4.1.11 — Properties of order on $\mathbb{Z}$ | `notes-int-tao-construction.tex` | Each property (reflexivity, transitivity, antisymmetry) checked directly from definition |
| Transitivity of integer equality | `notes-int-tao-construction.tex` | Use P2.2.6 (cancellation in $\mathbb{N}$); the key exercise in equivalence class manipulation |
| Multiplication is well-defined on $\mathbb{Z}$ | `notes-int-tao-construction.tex` | Same pattern as L4.1.3 but for $\times$; expand and regroup four terms using commutativity/associativity in $\mathbb{N}$ |
