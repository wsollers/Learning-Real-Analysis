\medskip
\noindent\textbf{How we got here.}
Logic gave us the language of valid inference and sets gave us the
objects we reason about. This chapter asks the operational question:
how do we build a valid mathematical argument from start to finish?

\medskip
\noindent\textbf{What this chapter builds.}
A complete architecture for proof writing: how to read a statement
and identify its proof strategy immediately; how to execute that
strategy step by step; how to use induction to reason about
well-ordered and recursive structures; and how to deploy specific
algebraic tactics when progress stalls.

\medskip
\noindent\textbf{Where this leads.}
Every proof in every subsequent chapter uses this toolkit.
Epsilon-delta analysis uses direct proof and contradiction.
Algebraic structure proofs use the uniqueness and
satisfy-and-cite patterns. Induction appears throughout
number theory, algebra, and combinatorics.

\subsection*{Structural Roadmap}

This chapter is organized in six sections of increasing specificity.

\begin{center}
\textbf{Architecture $\longrightarrow$ Construction
$\longrightarrow$ Structures $\longrightarrow$ Induction
$\longrightarrow$ Tactics $\longrightarrow$ Reference}
\end{center}

Sections 1--4 should be read sequentially on first pass.
Sections 5--6 are reference material to consult when working a
proof and progress stalls.

\begin{remark}[Four distinct questions]
\textbf{Architecture} answers: what kind of proof is this and what
skeleton should it have?
\textbf{Construction} answers: how do I execute that skeleton
line by line?
\textbf{Structures} answers: what do the standard proof patterns
look like in practice?
\textbf{Tactics} answers: once a proof is in progress,
what specific moves are available?
These are four different questions. Conflating them is the most
common source of proof-writing paralysis.
