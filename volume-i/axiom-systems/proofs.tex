% Axiom Systems — Proofs
%
% The Peano axioms themselves require no proof (they are axioms).
% Proof exercises for the arithmetic of N (addition, multiplication,
% order, and exponentiation) have moved to:
%
%   volume-ii/natural-numbers/proofs/
%
% That is where all Tao §2.2--2.3 and Mendelson §2.6 exercises live.

\begin{remark}[Proof exercises]
Exercises on arithmetic over $\mathbb{N}$ --- addition, order,
multiplication, and exponentiation --- are located in
\textbf{Volume~II, Natural Numbers}, which is where the
arithmetic development lives.
\end{remark}
