\subsection*{Monotonicity}
\label{prf:vn-monotone}

\begin{remark}[Return]
\hyperref[cor:vn-monotone]{$\leftarrow$ Back to Corollary (Monotonicity) in Notes}
\end{remark}

\begin{corollary}[Monotonicity]
If $m < n$, then $m_V \subsetneq n_V$.
\end{corollary}

\begin{proof}
\Given Each numeral is the set of its predecessors
(\hyperref[cor:vn-predecessors]{Each numeral is the set of its predecessors}):
$n_V = \{k_V : k < n\}$.

\Goal To show $m_V \subseteq n_V$ and $m_V \neq n_V$ whenever $m < n$.

\medskip
\noindent\textbf{$m_V \subseteq n_V$.} Let $x \in m_V$. Since $m_V = \{k_V :
k < m\}$, we have $x = k_V$ for some $k < m$. Since $k < m < n$, $k < n$, so
$k_V \in n_V = \{k_V : k < n\}$. Hence $x \in n_V$.

\medskip
\noindent\textbf{$m_V \neq n_V$.} Since $m < n$, we have $m_V \in n_V = \{k_V
: k < n\}$. If $m_V = n_V$, then $n_V \in n_V$, i.e.\ $n_V$ contains itself.
But by the Axiom of Foundation this is impossible. Hence $m_V \neq n_V$.

Therefore $m_V \subsetneq n_V$. \AsReq
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}[Proof shape]
The subset direction is a direct membership-chase using the ``predecessors''
characterisation. Strictness ($m_V \neq n_V$) requires ruling out $n_V \in
n_V$, which is done by Foundation (or alternatively by distinctness of
numerals: $m \neq n$ implies $m_V \neq n_V$).
\end{remark}

\begin{remark}[Alternative for strictness without Foundation]
One can avoid invoking Foundation for strictness by instead using
\hyperref[prop:vn-successor-injective]{Successor is injective} and the
distinctness of von Neumann numerals (which follows from the injectivity result
by induction, analogously to the Zermelo case). The Foundation route is shorter
but depends on a stronger axiom.
\end{remark}

\begin{remark}[Dependencies]
The proof depends on: \hyperref[cor:vn-predecessors]{Each numeral is the set of
its predecessors} and the Axiom of Foundation for the strictness half.
\end{remark}
