\subsection*{Injectivity of Zermelo Successor}
\label{prf:zermelo-successor-injective}

\begin{proposition}[Injectivity of Zermelo successor]
For all sets $a, b$, $S_Z(a) = S_Z(b) \Rightarrow a = b$.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
\Given The Zermelo successor $S_Z(n) = \{n\}$
(\hyperref[def:zermelo-successor]{Definition~(Zermelo successor)}). The
Proposition that singletons are well-defined
(\hyperref[prop:singleton-well-defined]{Singleton is well-defined}): the unique
element of $\{a\}$ is $a$.

\Goal To show: if $\{a\} = \{b\}$ then $a = b$.

\Strategy Suppose $\{a\} = \{b\}$. We extract the unique element of each side
and use the fact that equal sets have the same elements.

Since $\{a\} = \{b\}$, the sets have the same elements. We know $a \in \{a\}$
(by definition of singleton). Therefore $a \in \{b\}$. By definition of $\{b\}$,
the only element of $\{b\}$ is $b$. Hence $a = b$. \AsReq
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}[Proof shape]
The argument is a one-step membership extraction. If two singletons are equal as
sets, then any element of one is an element of the other. Since $a$ is the
unique element of $\{a\}$ and also an element of $\{b\}$, and $b$ is the unique
element of $\{b\}$, we conclude $a = b$. The proof does not require the Axiom
of Foundation; it uses only the definition of singleton and set equality.
\end{remark}

\begin{remark}[Contrast with von Neumann successor]
The von Neumann successor $S_V(n) = n \cup \{n\}$ also satisfies injectivity,
but the proof there is more involved because $S_V(a)$ has more than one element
when $a \neq \varnothing$. For Zermelo numerals, injectivity is immediate
because each successor is a singleton.
\end{remark}

\begin{remark}[Dependencies]
The proof depends on: the Definition of Zermelo successor
(\hyperref[def:zermelo-successor]{Definition~(Zermelo successor)}) and
\hyperref[prop:singleton-well-defined]{Singleton is well-defined}.
