\medskip
\noindent\textbf{How we got here.}
Logic gave us a precise language. We now need mathematical objects to
reason \emph{about}. Sets are the universe of mathematical objects;
functions are the structure-preserving maps between them.
Together they provide the language of all subsequent mathematics.

\medskip
\noindent\textbf{What this chapter builds.}
We develop naïve and axiomatic set theory: membership, subsets,
operations, power sets, and families. Relations --- including equivalence
relations and partial orders --- give us structure on sets.
Functions capture how sets relate to each other: injections, surjections,
bijections, and cardinality.

\medskip
\noindent\textbf{Where this leads.}
Every algebraic structure is a set with additional operations.
Every proof about $\mathbb{N}$, $\mathbb{Z}$, $\mathbb{R}$ uses
the function and relation vocabulary established here.
Equivalence relations appear again in the integer and rational constructions;
order relations appear throughout analysis.

% =========================================================
\subsection*{Structural Roadmap}

Each major topic is organised as:
\begin{center}
\textbf{Definitions $\longrightarrow$ Main Theorems
$\longrightarrow$ Consequences and Structural Insight}
\end{center}

The global progression is:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Sets: membership, subsets, operations (union, intersection, difference),
        power sets, the empty set
  \item Relations: binary relations, properties (reflexive, symmetric, transitive),
        composition
  \item Families: indexed families, arbitrary unions and intersections
  \item Equivalence relations: equivalence classes, partitions, quotient sets
  \item Functions: domain, codomain, image, injection, surjection, bijection,
        composition, inverse
  \item Order: partial orders, total orders, well-orders, Zorn's lemma
\end{enumerate}
