\begin{tabular}{|p{5.5cm}|p{7.5cm}|}
\hline
\textbf{Fallacy} & \textbf{Diagnostic Question} \\ \hline
Failure to flip quantifier under negation & Was $\forall$ changed to $\exists$ (or vice versa) when negating? \\ \hline
Negating predicate only & Was only the predicate negated while the quantifier was left unchanged? \\ \hline
Partial quantifier negation & When negating nested quantifiers, were \emph{all} quantifiers flipped? \\ \hline
Quantifier order confusion & Was the order of quantifiers changed without justification? \\ \hline
Illicit quantifier swap & Were $\forall$ and $\exists$ commuted when they are not of the same type? \\ \hline
Variable capture & Did substitution introduce a variable that became bound unintentionally? \\ \hline
Illegal existential instantiation & Was a witness chosen before an existential statement was established? \\ \hline
Illicit universal generalization & Was a universally quantified conclusion drawn from a statement depending on a specific object? \\ \hline
Scope ambiguity & Was the scope of a quantifier unclear or implicitly extended beyond its syntactic bounds? \\ \hline
Vacuous quantification misuse & Was a quantifier added or removed even though the variable does not occur free in the formula? \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\begin{remark}
Quantifier errors almost always stem from ignoring scope or treating quantifiers
as informal linguistic modifiers. Every quantifier introduces a binding context
that must be respected syntactically before semantic reasoning is applied.

\begin{tabular}{|p{4.5cm}|p{4.5cm}|p{4.5cm}|}
\hline
\textbf{Original} & \textbf{Incorrect Negation} & \textbf{Why It Is Wrong} \\ \hline
$\forall x\,P(x)$ & $\forall x\,\neg P(x)$ & Fails to flip the quantifier; asserts everyone fails $P$. \\ \hline
$\exists x\,P(x)$ & $\exists x\,\neg P(x)$ & Negates the predicate but not the existential claim. \\ \hline
$\forall x\,\exists y\,P(x,y)$ & $\exists x\,\exists y\,\neg P(x,y)$ & Only the outer quantifier was flipped. \\ \hline
$\exists x\,\forall y\,P(x,y)$ & $\forall x\,\forall y\,\neg P(x,y)$ & Overstrengthened the negation. \\ \hline
$\forall x\,(P(x)\rightarrow Q(x))$ & $\forall x\,(P(x)\wedge \neg Q(x))$ & Correct negation is $\exists x\,(P(x)\wedge \neg Q(x))$. \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\begin{remark}[Negation discipline]
When negating a quantified statement, push the negation inward across
\emph{every} quantifier, flipping each one, until it reaches the atomic
predicate. Negating only the predicate or only one quantifier changes the
logical claim in an incorrect direction.
\end{remark}

\begin{remark}[Common inference rule errors]\label{rem:inf-errors}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Choosing a witness before establishing an existential premise.
  \item Using a witness constant introduced by EI outside its allowed scope.
  \item Generalizing universally over a variable that depends on a special
  assumption.
  \item Substituting inside the scope of a quantifier without checking for
  variable capture.
  \item Replacing a term by an equal term in one occurrence but not another.
\end{itemize}
\end{remark}

\begin{remark}
A useful informal check: if a proof step would still make sense after replacing
$\forall$ with ``for most'' or $\exists$ with ``maybe'', the step is almost
certainly invalid.
\end{remark}
